subtitle: Welcome to Urja
body_1: URJA TRUST is a Mumbai (India) based grassroots organisation working to empower homeless young women, with a rights based intersectional perspective that explores the issues of homeless young women through the lens of gender, caste, mental health and violence. Our organisation’s values and principles are aligned with the Indian constitution, Human Rights Framework and the  UN’s Sustainable Development Goals ensuring good health and well-being (Goal 3), Quality Education (Goal 4), Gender Equality (Goal 5), Decent work and economic growth (Goal 8), Reduced Inequality (Goal 10) and Peace and justice strong institutions (Goal 16).
body_2: The founders of URJA, Deepali Kamble and Altaf Shaikh, have experienced gender, caste and religious violence up close personally , and have always found themselves more attuned to the sufferings of the marginalised sections of the society. They have witnessed up close how women and children were the worst affected during the different communal riots, be it the Mumbai riots in 92, or the Godhra riots in 2002, leaving several families without homes overnight. These experiences played a key role in making them reach out to the people forced to live on streets due to various socio- economic and political factors. It also brought forth the fact for them, that while there are several organisations working with homeless children, there are hardly any working with homeless young women from religious minorities and other marginalised sections of the society  with an intersectional rights based perspective. The critical need for working with this group is what prompted them to start URJA TRUST.
body_3: URJA was registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The Trust believes that the aid, development and ultimate transformation of young homeless women entails not just economic sufficiency but also mental health stabilization. In 2012, Urja opened its first centre at Dadar, Mumbai. The small team worked together with an indomitable spirit to fight for the rights and rehabilitation of young women who find themselves homeless. In due course, the outreach programme was initiated whereby the team regularly surveyed railway stations to identify and approach vulnerable women. This allowed Urja to build a very strong network of stakeholders including police, railway officials and lawyers at these places.
body_4: Today URJA has managed to make a name for itself at state and national level as one of the few organisations working around issues of violence against women and homelessness with a holistic and rights based approach. It is part of various state level committees and continues to raise voices around the issues of gender, caste, sexuality and mental health. Recently URJA has also been chosen as a partner organisation to run One Stop Crisis Centre in Mumbai suburbs. Till date it has worked along with more than 600 homeless young women.

- name: DEEPALI VANDANA
  image: /images/uploads/person_1.jpg
  role: Co-founder
  about: "She began working towards social change when she was 18 years old, questioning the injustice faced by women and individuals from lower classes and castes. She was inspired by the life of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar among many others and began to encourage young girls, like herself, to understand and raise their voices against social injustice. Deepali’s love for taking risks and her resolve in addressing challenges eventually led her to advocate for the cause of homeless young women. She truly believes that this group of individuals, albeit vulnerable, is brave enough to challenge discriminatory social norms and holds a chance at molding their own destiny.Deepali has a Master’s degree in Economics and is currently pursuing her Management Studies. She has extensively worked with youth and women for the past 18 years and has advocated for them in various government bodies like the Juvenile Justice Board and the Department of Women and Child Development. To help deal with instances of conflict with law, Deepali has been conducting police training sessions on the rights of juveniles, and has also been involved in research on the Aftercare Program for vulnerable individuals in Maharashtra. Furthermore, she has been holding training sessions for other stakeholders: NGOs, young women and so on. As an emerging leader, Deepali has collaborated with different human rights movements and networks all over the country. She has used her experience and learning to fuel the mission of Urja, which in turn has allowed her to work compassionately with young women and the government alike."

  role: Co-founder
  about: At Pratha, she started her career with the implementation of the Slum Sanitation Program in the slums of Mumbai. Presently, she is involved with the project management services of MCGM for monitoring the activities under the Slum Sanitation Program (SSP). Her experience in sanitation for the last four years gave her tremendous insight into other related issues like seepage management, health and hygiene, sustainable sanitation and improving the quality of sanitation facilities provided by MCGM. She is an expert in her own right when it comes to working in slum communities of Mumbai, community mobilization, formation of Community Based Organizations, report writing, networking, conducting surveys, hosting trainings and events, and forming liaisons with MCGM and various other government departments. In 2004, Aditi and Deepali worked together on a rehabilitation program for street children, understanding in the process their similar individual strengths. Aditi had always wanted to work for the rights of women and Urja proved to be the perfect avenue to actualize her passion. She works with renewed dedication with our young women and is the link between them and the opportunities provided by the outside world.
- name: ALTAF SHAIKH
  image: /images/uploads/person_3.jpg
  role: Co-founder
  about: In his 35 years in the development sector, Altaf started off as a volunteer working with children living on the streets and went on to become one of the founder members of Saathi, an NGO which works with youth living on the streets and their rehabilitation.This intense and ongoing engagement has not only exposed him to various dimensions of work with children and young adults, and various strategies of interventions but also the nuances of organizational functioning like governance, leadership facilitation, program planning, monitoring and evaluation. Altaf has been using the ‘Outward-Bound’ Learning Methodology (OBL) to stimulate and motivate participants. The framework and design of these wilderness programs are built to create a series of intense, life-like experiences and simulations that engage participants by enabling them to get in touch with their mental and physical capacities, things that may have been corroded over years. Altaf’s expertise has been strengthening and conditioning the foundation of the organization and encouraging the journey forward.
