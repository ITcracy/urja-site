  We believe that our strength lies in unity. A better world will only be possible if we all work together.  You can become an integral part of our journey by volunteering and working with us.

  You can also choose to become a fundraiser. You could do so by working towards strengthening communities and sharing the power to lead a dignified life with the young women at Urja by starting your own fundraising page. The more the number of people involve themselves with such a cause, the better the future of these women will be.

  Get started today!
