    Working with Deepali and her incredible team at Urja was my first experience in the NGO space in Mumbai. I was able to take part in the outreach programme at Dadar Station, and utilise my social work experience from Australia in a different context. What Urja is able to achieve despite limited resources is a testimony of their commitment to the cause of womenâ€™s rights. I hope to work with them again in the future.

  name: Prathiksha Prakash , Intern, University Law College, Bengaluru.
  content: I was pursuing law at the time of my internship, and assumed I would be
    into black and white sort of work.  However, I was more than happy to have been
    exposed to activities like outreach, field visits, case work etc. Each of these
    tasks gave me a different perspective towards life, and every member of team URJA
    gave me a lesson and a memory for life.

  content: I am proud to support an organisation that empowers battered, homeless
    and broken young women to be independent and live with self respect and dignity.
    URJA ensures all round development of these homeless young women and their children,
    empowering them with an ability to be not just economically self sufficient, but
    also mentally stable.
