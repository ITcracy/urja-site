side_content: The nationwide lockdown that followed the onset of the global pandemic has not been so easy of marginalised and vulnerable sections of society, especially homeless young women that we work with. Our team has been working round the clock during the emergency situation, seeing to it that we reach out to homeless young women and other vulnerable groups to the best of our abilities.


    **Through our Covid-19 Responses we have reached out to  homeless young women and vulnerable families. Our efforts were focussed at providing them with not only monthly ration, but also supporting them to pay their monthly rent, phone top ups, and providing them with counselling and referrals to police and shelter homes.**

##### Homeless Young Women at our Shelter
Most of the young women we work with are malnourished with compromised immunity and, thus our aim was to continue providing adequate nutrition, as well as follow and maintain the sanitation compliances, to prevent anyone from getting infected at the shelter home, putting others at a great risk. The Lock down also had severe implications on the livelihood of many of the young women where several of them lost their jobs, rendering them vulnerable financially and emotionally. Throughout the lock down we have been in regular touch with all the young women, providing them with telephonic counselling, monthly ration, cooking gas and other essentials. In certain cases we also supported them by paying their rent and doing their mobile recharge so that they can be in touch with their friends and family, and not feel isolated and lonely in such uncertain times.

##### Survivors of Domestic Violence
Home not being a safe space for several women, we saw a rise in the number of young women facing domestic violence reaching out to us. We have supported young women, by providing them with counselling and referring them to police, shelter and other government services.

##### Vulnerable Families
We also identified vulnerable and homeless families of daily wage workers who are not able to access government services or resources because of lack of documents. We have been continuously supporting such families by providing them with essential kits.

We recognise that one time support is not enough for those worst affected by the Pandemic, and there needs to be continued support for all of us to emerge safe and healthy through this. Join us and be our co-traveller in this journey with homeless young women and vulnerable families!

We have started a fund-raiser on Milaap to keep assisting these groups Milaap. To support click [here](#)
