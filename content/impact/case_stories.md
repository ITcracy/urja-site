  content: "**STORY OF STRUGGLE, AND COURAGE AGAINST ALL ODDS** \n\nAarti, aged 20
    years, belongs to a tribal community and has hearing impairment since her birth.
    At an early age she had been abducted by a man who forcefully married her. She
    faced great physical and emotional violence at the hands of her husband and his
    first wife. Her parents also refused to accept her back fearing boycott from their
    community and instead brought her to URJA in August 2018. At URJA our holistic
    interventions facilitated Aarti to become more focused and mentally relaxed. We
    introduced her to Tata Mumbai Marathon, giving her an immediate goal and objective
    to work towards. With just two months of training, she stood second in her age
    group in the marathon.Currently she is working at Mirchi and Mime, a restaurant
    run by hearing impaired employees. Aarti has moved from crisis shelter home to
    short stay home. Along with her job, she is also preparing for her 12th exams
    through distance learning."

    **COPING BETRAYALS AND MENTAL ILLNESS WITH A WARRIOR SPIRIT!**

    Zahira, 19 years old came to Mumbai to be with her husband, but he refused to acknowledge her, and hence was brought to URJA in July 2018 by the police. Initially Zahira had a low sense of self worth, deep sense of abandonment and would also experience episodes of psychosis. On psychiatric assessment, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. At URJA, Zahira was provided with regular counseling and was also referred to Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is a type of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy to help better treat borderline personality disorder. Zahira has not had any episodes of psychosis recently, and is now better equipped to stay calm in situations of conflict and her relationship with others at the shelter has also improved. Zahira is currently going for English speaking classes and is receiving training in beauty and hair by Nalini and Yasmin, a renowned name in the hair and beauty industry.
