  content: "**STORY OF STRUGGLE, AND COURAGE AGAINST ALL ODDS** \n\nAarti, aged 20
    years, belongs to a tribal community and has hearing impairment since her birth.
    At an early age she had been abducted by a man who forcefully married her. She
    faced great physical and emotional violence at the hands of her husband and his
    first wife. Her parents also refused to accept her back fearing boycott from their
    community and instead brought her to URJA in August 2018. At URJA our holistic
    interventions facilitated Aarti to become more focused and mentally relaxed. We
    introduced her to Tata Mumbai Marathon, giving her an immediate goal and objective
    to work towards. With just two months of training, she stood second in her age
    group in the marathon.Currently she is working at Mirchi and Mime, a restaurant
    run by hearing impaired employees. Aarti has moved from crisis shelter home to
    short stay home. Along with her job, she is also preparing for her 12th exams
    through distance learning."

    URJA was registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The Trust believes that the aid, development and ultimate transformation of young homeless women entails not just economic sufficiency but also mental health stabilization. In 2012, Urja opened its first centre at Dadar, Mumbai.
    - First Objective
    - Second Objective
    - Third Objective

    The small team worked together with an indomitable spirit to fight for the rights and rehabilitation of young women who find themselves homeless. In due course, the outreach programme was initiated whereby the team regularly surveyed railway stations to identify and approach vulnerable women. This allowed Urja to build a very strong network of stakeholders including police, railway officials and lawyers at these places.
