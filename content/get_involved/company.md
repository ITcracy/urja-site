quote: Your contribution is essential to facilitate the journey of young women, who are abused, discriminated against and forced to leave their homes. 
description: For us partnership, along with sustained funding, also means expertise and exposure to new areas, fields and people. It also goes a long way in strengthening and  amplifying the voices of the homeless young women locally and globally.

We can assure you that your contribution will have a lasting impact in the endeavours of the young women to lead their lives with dignity. 

To ensure transparency and an honest relationship with our partners, we share regular updates through our monthly newsletter, six monthly programme reports. We constantly update our website on the programme activities and events where you can see the impact of our donation. You can access our programmes page [ here ](/approach)

We also publish yearly annual and financial reports, which you can access [ here ](/impact/#annual_reports)

Partnering with us will also mean getting a chance to interact with our team members, board, visit our shelter and get to see our operations first and the young women whose journey you will be supporting.
