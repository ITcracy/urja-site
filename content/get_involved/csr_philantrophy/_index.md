- **Employee Engagement**

    A great way for your organisation’s employees to donate their time and skills to the organisation and in exchange also learn about pertinent ground issues regarding homelessness amongst young women. 

- **Cause Related Support**

    Support an URJA project that aligns with your company’s vision. It also showcases your goodwill and gives you more visibility, which in turn also amplifies the voices of homeless young women.

- **Payroll Giving**

    Opt to deduct a small amount from the salaries every month, to share with URJA. These amounts will cumulatively go a long way to support our projects and processes. Each of the employees will receive a tax exempt receipt at the end of the financial year.

- **Tata Mumbai Marathon**

    The young women at URJA run every year at this big event, and you too can stand in solidarity with them by running on behalf of URJA. Be our corporate partner for the next TMM!
