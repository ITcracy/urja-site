As a feminist organisation working with survivors of violence, we strongly believe that there are no short cuts to justice and ending sexual crimes through punitive measures. 
We need to walk together on this long and complicated path to dismantling casteist, community based patriarchal privilege and power that cuts across the society and further perpetuates violence against women.
We donâ€™t believe death penalty is an answer to this and strongly condemn the Maharashtra Shakti Bill 2020.
