The Census of India 2011 defines 'houseless household' as, 'households who do not live in buildings or census houses but live in the open on roadside, pavements, in huge pipes, under flyovers and staircases, or in the open in places of worship, mandaps, railway platforms, etc.”

Exploring the issue of ‘Homelessness’ through an intersectional lens of different structures of power like gender, caste, religion and sexuality, brings forth that even today Indian women rarely have spaces that they can call as their own. Most of the women across the different class and caste still do not have claim to their ancestral property, rendering them in a vulnerable position and forcing them to compromise and face violence silently. According to National Family Health Survey-4, conducted between 2015-16, almost 30% of married women reported facing domestic violence and abuse.
