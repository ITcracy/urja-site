URJA was registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The Trust believes
that the aid, development and ultimate transformation of young homeless women entails
not just economic sufficiency but also mental health stabilization. In 2012, Urja
opened its first centre at Dadar, Mumbai. The small team worked together with an
indomitable spirit to fight for the rights and rehabilitation of young women who
find themselves homeless. In due course, the outreach programme was initiated whereby
the team regularly surveyed railway stations to identify and approach vulnerable
women. This allowed Urja to build a very strong network of stakeholders including
police, railway officials and lawyers at these places.

Today URJA has managed to make a name for itself at state and national level
as one of the few organisations working around issues of violence against women
and homelessness with a holistic and rights based approach. It is part of various
state level committees and continues to raise voices around the issues of gender,
caste, sexuality and mental health. Recently URJA has also been chosen as a partner
organisation to run One Stop Crisis Centre in Mumbai suburbs. Till date it has worked
along with more than 600 homeless young women.
