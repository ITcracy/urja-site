**We are based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, but are actively involved at National and International level through our advocacy initiatives.**

Our shelter home is based out of Dadar, Mumbai, which provides a safe space to homeless young women and their children coming to Mumbai from all across the country.  
As the implementing organization since May 2020 , for the One Stop Center Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, we are based out of Balasaheb Thakare Trauma hospital, Jogeshwari, Mumbai.  
We also work with marginalized communities in several urban slums across MMRDA and Mumbai Suburbs.
