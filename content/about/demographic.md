We work with such **Homeless Young Women** between the ages of 18-30 years **,** and in certain cases their children**,** who in the bid to escape violence ( physical, mental, emotional and sexual) and other reasons including, but not limited to, a desire to improve their circumstances and lead a life of their own choice, break free from the vicious circle of poverty, dysfunctional families, discrimination faced by them or the community they belong to, etc. are forced to leave, or thrown out of “their homes”.

* These women more than often belong to the most marginalized communities in terms of class, caste and religion.
* Malnutritioned, poor health, no access to health services and rights- physical, sexual and mental health, low educational levels and skill sets, which has a severe impact on their overall mental health and holistic development.
* Social, economic and political rights being denied, further leading to a downward spiral into homelessness.

**OUR ROOTS**

Our Founders, Deepali Kamble and Altaf Shaikh, have experienced gender, caste and religious violence up close personally. They have witnessed how women and children were the worst affected during the different communal riots, calamities and disasters, leaving several families without homes overnight. These experiences have played a key role in making them reach out to those rendered homeless due to various socio- economic and political factors. The critical need for working with homeless young women from religious minorities and other marginalized sections of the society with an intersectional rights based perspective, is what prompted them to start URJA TRUST.
