We work with such **Homeless Young Women** between the ages of 18-30 years **,** and in certain cases their children, who in the bid to escape violence ( physical, mental, emotional and sexual) and other reasons including, but not limited to, a desire to improve their circumstances and lead a life of their own choice, break free from the vicious circle of poverty, dysfunctional families, discrimination faced by them or the community they belong to, etc. are forced to leave, or thrown out of “their homes”.

* These women more than often belong to the most marginalized communities in terms of class, caste and religion.
* Malnutritioned, poor health, no access to health services and rights- physical, sexual and mental health, low educational levels and skill sets, which has a severe impact on their overall mental health and holistic development.
* Social, economic and political rights being denied, further leading to a downward spiral into homelessness.
