The Census of India 2011 defines 'houseless household' as, 'households who do not live in buildings or census houses but live in the open on roadside, pavements, in huge pipes, under flyovers and staircases, or in the open in places of worship, mandaps, railway platforms, etc.”

Exploring the issue of ‘Homelessness’ through an intersectional lens of different structures of power like gender, caste, religion and sexuality, brings forth that even today Indian women rarely have spaces that they can call as their own. Most of the women across the different class and caste still do not have claim to their ancestral property, rendering them in a vulnerable position and forcing them to compromise and face violence silently. According to National Family Health Survey-4, conducted between 2015-16, almost 30% of married women reported facing domestic violence and abuse.

**“_Richa married at the age of 11, but was forced to leave home after just 2 years because of emotional and physical abuse from her husband's family. She was found sleeping on the streets by two people who led her to believe they would take her to a safe place, instead they sold her for Rs 50,000. Richa was fortunate, as the same night she was sold there was a raid by the police, and she was rescued. However, soon after Richa found herself in an abusive marriage with two children, turning to prostitution to earn some money.”_**

Richa’s is not a lone instance, there are several women like her , who In the bid to escape violence ( physical, mental, emotional and sexual) and other reasons including, but not limited to, a desire to improve their circumstances and lead a life of their own choice, break free from the vicious circle of poverty, dysfunctional families, discrimination faced by them or the community they belong to, etc. are forced to , or thrown out of “their homes”.

Though the data with regard to homeless young women in the country is sketchy, we can estimate the gravity of the situation from the figures below-

* In India, the number of homeless people declined by about 66,000 households in rural areas, and went up by about 69,000 households in urban areas in 2013
* A 2003 ActionAid India report estimated that the total homeless population in India is 78 million.
* According to the Census of 2011, India has more than 1.7 million homeless residents, of which 938,384 are located in urban areas. These figures, however, grossly underestimate the real numbers of the homeless. Civil society organizations estimate that at least one per cent of the population of urban India is homeless. Based on this, it can be extrapolated that the population of the urban homeless is at least 3 million.
* Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh account for about half the country's homeless population
* According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty (NLCHP), more than 90 percent of homeless women are victims of domestic violence which results in their escaping from their homes
* According to the NLCHP, the lack of affordable housing is a primary cause of homelessness
* Reports say that about 20 to 25 percent of the homeless suffer from severe mental illness.

In such situations when young women end up on streets they further face violence and exploitation, and are forced to live in extreme inhumane conditions. State response to the needs of homeless young women is grossly inadequate and  most of the women are left to fend for themselves. Several of them, having left their homes without any documents of identity, face challenges in accessing their basic civil rights like housing, employment and other social security benefits. It is a vicious cycle further marginalizing and violating the already marginalised section of the society.

Mumbai sees an inflow of homeless young women from all across the country. Every year URJA works with more than 100 homeless young women between the age group of 18- 30 years of age.

Most of these homeless young women belong to the minority and marginalised communities in terms of caste, religion and class, which doubly marginalises them. A further vulnerable group amongst homeless young women are women with disabilities, mental health problems,single women and single homeless mothers;women living with HIV/AIDS; chemically dependent women and victims of substance abuse; pregnant and lactating women; women with small children; and girls and adolescents.

Though there are several organisations working around the issue of Homelessness in India, there are very few working with the dynamic group of homeless young women with an intersectional and holistic approach to address the root causes of different forms of violence against women that render them homeless.
