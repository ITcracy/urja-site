- name: DEEPALI VANDANA
  image: "/images/uploads/person_1.jpg"
  role: Co-founder
  about: 'She began working towards social change when she was 18 years old, questioning
    the injustice faced by women and individuals from lower classes and castes. She
    was inspired by the life of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar among many others and began
    to encourage young girls, like herself, to understand and raise their voices against
    social injustice. Deepali’s love for taking risks and her resolve in addressing
    challenges eventually led her to advocate for the cause of homeless young women.
    She truly believes that this group of individuals, albeit vulnerable, is brave
    enough to challenge discriminatory social norms and holds a chance at molding
    their own destiny.Deepali has a Master’s degree in Economics and is currently
    pursuing her Management Studies. She has extensively worked with youth and women
    for the past 18 years and has advocated for them in various government bodies
    like the Juvenile Justice Board and the Department of Women and Child Development.
    To help deal with instances of conflict with law, Deepali has been conducting
    police training sessions on the rights of juveniles, and has also been involved
    in research on the Aftercare Program for vulnerable individuals in Maharashtra.
    Furthermore, she has been holding training sessions for other stakeholders: NGOs,
    young women and so on. As an emerging leader, Deepali has collaborated with different
    human rights movements and networks all over the country. She has used her experience
    and learning to fuel the mission of Urja, which in turn has allowed her to work
    compassionately with young women and the government alike.'

    Program in the slums of Mumbai. Presently, she is involved with the project management
    services of MCGM for monitoring the activities under the Slum Sanitation Program
    (SSP). Her experience in sanitation for the last four years gave her tremendous
    insight into other related issues like seepage management, health and hygiene,
    sustainable sanitation and improving the quality of sanitation facilities provided
    by MCGM. She is an expert in her own right when it comes to working in slum communities
    of Mumbai, community mobilization, formation of Community Based Organizations,
    report writing, networking, conducting surveys, hosting trainings and events,
    and forming liaisons with MCGM and various other government departments. In 2004,
    Aditi and Deepali worked together on a rehabilitation program for street children,
    understanding in the process their similar individual strengths. Aditi had always
    wanted to work for the rights of women and Urja proved to be the perfect avenue
    to actualize her passion. She works with renewed dedication with our young women
    and is the link between them and the opportunities provided by the outside world.

    working with children living on the streets and went on to become one of the founder
    members of Saathi, an NGO which works with youth living on the streets and their
    rehabilitation.This intense and ongoing engagement has not only exposed him to
    various dimensions of work with children and young adults, and various strategies
    of interventions but also the nuances of organizational functioning like governance,
    leadership facilitation, program planning, monitoring and evaluation. Altaf has
    been using the ‘Outward-Bound’ Learning Methodology (OBL) to stimulate and motivate
    participants. The framework and design of these wilderness programs are built
    to create a series of intense, life-like experiences and simulations that engage
    participants by enabling them to get in touch with their mental and physical capacities,
    things that may have been corroded over years. Altaf’s expertise has been strengthening
