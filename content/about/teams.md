      Program in the slums of Mumbai. She has worked with MCGM for monitoring the
      activities under the Slum Sanitation Program (SSP). Her experience in sanitation

      like seepage management, health and hygiene, sustainable sanitation and improving
      the quality of sanitation facilities provided by MCGM. She is an expert in her
      own right when it comes to working in slum communities of Mumbai, community
      mobilization, formation of Community Based Organizations, report writing, networking,
      conducting surveys, hosting trainings and events, and forming liaisons with
      MCGM and various other government departments. In 2004, Aditi and Deepali worked
      together on a rehabilitation program for street children, understanding in the
      process their similar individual strengths. Aditi had always wanted to work
      for the rights of women and Urja proved to be the perfect avenue to actualize
      her passion. She works with renewed dedication with our young women and is the
      link between them and the opportunities provided by the outside world.

    about: In his 35 years in the development sector, Altaf started off as a volunteer
      working with children living on the streets and went on to become one of the
      founder members of Saathi, an NGO which works with youth living on the streets
      and their rehabilitation. This intense and ongoing engagement has not only exposed
      him to various dimensions of work with children and young adults, and various
      strategies of interventions but also the nuances of organizational functioning
      like governance, leadership facilitation, program planning, monitoring and evaluation.
      Altaf has been using the ‘Outward-Bound’ Learning Methodology (OBL) to stimulate
      and motivate participants. The framework and design of these wilderness programs
      are built to create a series of intense, life-like experiences and simulations
      that engage participants by enabling them to get in touch with their mental
      and physical capacities, things that may have been corroded over years. Altaf’s
      expertise has been strengthening and conditioning the foundation of the organization
      and encouraging the journey forward.
