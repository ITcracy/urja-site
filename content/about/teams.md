          about: 'She began working towards social change when she was 18 years old, questioning
            the injustice faced by women and individuals from lower classes and castes. She
            was inspired by the life of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar among many others and began
            to encourage young girls, like herself, to understand and raise their voices against
            social injustice. Deepali’s love for taking risks and her resolve in addressing
            challenges eventually led her to advocate for the cause of homeless young women.
            She truly believes that this group of individuals, albeit vulnerable, is brave
            enough to challenge discriminatory social norms and holds a chance at molding
            their own destiny.Deepali has a Master’s degree in Economics and is currently
            pursuing her Management Studies. She has extensively worked with youth and women
            for the past 18 years and has advocated for them in various government bodies
            like the Juvenile Justice Board and the Department of Women and Child Development.
            To help deal with instances of conflict with law, Deepali has been conducting
            police training sessions on the rights of juveniles, and has also been involved
            in research on the Aftercare Program for vulnerable individuals in Maharashtra.
            Furthermore, she has been holding training sessions for other stakeholders: NGOs,
            young women and so on. As an emerging leader, Deepali has collaborated with different
            human rights movements and networks all over the country. She has used her experience
            and learning to fuel the mission of Urja, which in turn has allowed her to work
            compassionately with young women and the government alike.'

            by MCGM. She is an expert in her own right when it comes to working in slum communities

            Aditi and Deepali worked together on a rehabilitation program for street children,
            understanding in the process their similar individual strengths. Aditi had always
            wanted to work for the rights of women and Urja proved to be the perfect avenue
            to actualize her passion. She works with renewed dedication with our young women
            and is the link between them and the opportunities provided by the outside world.

            members of Saathi, an NGO which works with youth living on the streets and their
            rehabilitation.This intense and ongoing engagement has not only exposed him to
            various dimensions of work with children and young adults, and various strategies
            of interventions but also the nuances of organizational functioning like governance,
            leadership facilitation, program planning, monitoring and evaluation. Altaf has
            been using the ‘Outward-Bound’ Learning Methodology (OBL) to stimulate and motivate
            participants. The framework and design of these wilderness programs are built

            participants by enabling them to get in touch with their mental and physical capacities,
            things that may have been corroded over years. Altaf’s expertise has been strengthening

            forward.
