Our Founders, Deepali Kamble and Altaf Shaikh, have experienced gender, caste and religious violence up close personally. They have witnessed how women and children were the worst affected during the different communal riots, calamities and disasters, leaving several families without homes overnight. These experiences have played a key role in making them reach out to those rendered homeless due to various socio- economic and political factors. The critical need for working with homeless young women from religious minorities and other marginalized sections of the society with an intersectional rights based perspective, is what prompted them to start URJA TRUST.
