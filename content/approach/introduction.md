URJA TRUST is a Mumbai (India) based grassroots organisation working to empower
homeless young women, with a rights based intersectional perspective that explores
the issues of homeless young women through the lens of gender, caste, mental health
and violence. Our organisation’s values and principles are aligned with the Indian
constitution, Human Rights Framework and the  UN’s Sustainable Development Goals
ensuring good health and well-being (Goal 3), Quality Education (Goal 4), Gender
Equality (Goal 5), Decent work and economic growth (Goal 8), Reduced Inequality
(Goal 10) and Peace and justice strong institutions (Goal 16).


The founders of URJA, Deepali Kamble and Altaf Shaikh, have experienced gender,
caste and religious violence up close personally , and have always found themselves
more attuned to the sufferings of the marginalised sections of the society. They
have witnessed up close how women and children were the worst affected during the
different communal riots, be it the Mumbai riots in 92, or the Godhra riots in 2002,
leaving several families without homes overnight. These experiences played a key
role in making them reach out to the people forced to live on streets due to various
socio- economic and political factors. It also brought forth the fact for them,
that while there are several organisations working with homeless children, there
are hardly any working with homeless young women from religious minorities and other
marginalised sections of the society  with an intersectional rights based perspective.
The critical need for working with this group is what prompted them to start URJA
TRUST.
