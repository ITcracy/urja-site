story_title: Homeless by Birth
story_description: In the casteist, patriarchal Indian society, womenâ€™s identity is attached to the men of their family, they have no or limited access to their ancestral property, leaving them with no place that they can call their own, forcing them to bear the violence in silence in absence of safe spaces.
quote: "We work at creating safe spaces for such homeless young women and empowering them as well as different systems to ensure a violence free and egalitarian society."
