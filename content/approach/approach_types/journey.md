    quote: "We aim at creating alternative inclusive, safe, empowering spaces for women so that they do not have to suffer violence in silence."
    content: "The immediate crisis that any homeless individual experiences is the lack of a safe space which only amplifies their fragility. Our shelters act as the immediate safety net, where they can recuperate from the violence that they have faced, connect with themselves and get empowered to break free from the cycle of violence. We aim at demonstrating a comprehensive shelter model that can be adopted and replicated by the government across different states."

    side_title: "Context"
    side_content: "Homeless Young Women continue to remain invisible with no access to their civil and political rights"
    quote: "URJA strives to ensure homeless young women’s rightful access to their civil rights and social security entitlements as the citizens of the country."
    content: "There is hardly any data pertaining to homeless young women in India, which further invisibles them and takes away their citizenship and rights as citizens of the country. Urja works with human rights lawyers and government/non-government bodies to expand homeless women’s access to civil and political rights. We have been successful in creating identity documents for the women, without the need of a guarantor."
summary: Our Journey with homeless young women is through an empowering holistic approach
  of safe spaces, holistic health and nutrition, therapy, skill and knowledge building,
  and ensuring access to their civil rights.
