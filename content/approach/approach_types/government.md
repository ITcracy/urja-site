The Sakhi - One Stop Centre scheme is an initiative of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, introduced in 2013 after the Nirbhaya incident. The objective of the scheme is to provide integrated and immediate support under one roof to women and girls who have been affected by violence in public or private spaces. 

As the implementing organisation, we are based out of Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma hospital, Jogeshwari, Mumbai. We provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence, both in private and public spaces, and facilitate immediate, emergency and non-emergency access to a range of services including medical, legal, psychological and counselling support all under one roof to fight against all forms of violence against women.
