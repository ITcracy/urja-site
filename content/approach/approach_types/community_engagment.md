      quote_heading: CONTEXT
      quote: One of our crucial learnings from the field has been that there is still a lack of understanding amongst community mobilizers , civil society organisations, government and health care service providers when it comes to mental health issues, and usually women with mental health conditions are labelled as ‘difficult’, ‘stubborn’ or ‘mad’ without really understanding or addressing her concerns. 
      side_heading: The community mental health program is an outcome of this learning, and our attempt at addressing this gap in the field.
      side_content: "The Community Mental Health Program aims at working closely with different community based organisations, government systems like police, shelter homes, mwcd , health care providers and community at large to-

- Facilitate open conversation around the issue of mental health.

- Work with self and use self as a tool by becoming change agents.

- Build capacity to understand mental health conditions, and make needed referrals to different systems.

- To create better support systems for people with mental health conditions within their community.

- To create awareness around the Mental Health Care Act , 2017 and strengthen its implementation.
