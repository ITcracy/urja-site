URJA was registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. The Trust believes
that the aid, development and ultimate transformation of young homeless women entails
not just economic sufficiency but also mental health stabilization. In 2012, Urja
opened its first centre at Dadar, Mumbai.

- First Objective

- Second Objective

- Third Objective

The small team worked together with an indomitable spirit to fight for the rights and rehabilitation of young women who
find themselves homeless. In due course, the outreach programme was initiated whereby
the team regularly surveyed railway stations to identify and approach vulnerable
women. This allowed Urja to build a very strong network of stakeholders including
police, railway officials and lawyers at these places.
