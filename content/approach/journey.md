URJA TRUST is a Mumbai (India) based grassroots organisation working to empower
homeless young women, with a rights based intersectional perspective that
explores the issues of homeless young women through the lens of gender, caste,
mental health and violence. Our organisation’s values and principles are
aligned with the Indian constitution, Human Rights Framework and the  UN’s
Sustainable Development Goals ensuring good health and well-being (Goal 3),
Quality Education (Goal 4), Gender Equality (Goal 5), Decent work and economic
growth (Goal 8), Reduced Inequality (Goal 10) and Peace and justice strong
institutions (Goal 16).

##### Homeless Young Women at our Shelter
Most of the young women we work with are malnourished with compromised immunity and, thus our aim was to continue providing adequate nutrition, as well as follow and maintain the sanitation compliances, to prevent anyone from getting infected at the shelter home, putting others at a great risk. The Lock down also had severe implications on the livelihood of many of the young women where several of them lost their jobs, rendering them vulnerable financially and emotionally. Throughout the lock down we have been in regular touch with all the young women, providing them with telephonic counselling, monthly ration, cooking gas and other essentials. In certain cases we also supported them by paying their rent and doing their mobile recharge so that they can be in touch with their friends and family, and not feel isolated and lonely in such uncertain times.

##### Survivors of Domestic Violence
Home not being a safe space for several women, we saw a rise in the number of young women facing domestic violence reaching out to us. We have supported young women, by providing them with counselling and referring them to police, shelter and other government services.

##### Vulnerable Families
We also identified vulnerable and homeless families of daily wage workers who are not able to access government services or resources because of lack of documents. We have been continuously supporting such families by providing them with essential kits.

We recognise that one time support is not enough for those worst affected by the Pandemic, and there needs to be continued support for all of us to emerge safe and healthy through this. Join us and be our co-traveller in this journey with homeless young women and vulnerable families!
